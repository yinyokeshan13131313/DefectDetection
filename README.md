# DefectDetection

This is a project to detect the defection of the products. This project will train the model by using the image so that it can detect the defection of the product automatically. The data used in this model is the image of cracked and non-cracked walls obtained from Kaggle. There is one ipynb file in this project, which contains the code in python language.

In the data file, there will be two subfiles, which are 'Positive' and 'Negative' files. 'Positive' file contains 20,000 images of cracked wall, where 'Negative' file contains 20,000 images of non-cracked wall. 

In this project, the detection is done by performing deep learning in python. The models applied in this project is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
